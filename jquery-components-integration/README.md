## License

In order to use these components integrated in the samples you will need a license agreement. To obtain it, please contact support@innovatrics.com.

## Project setup

For detection to work, all files from the `dot-assets` folder from every component must be fetchable. This means that a web server must be used for development, as `file:///` URLs are not allowed for WebAssembly binaries.

## Development server

Run `npx http-server . -p 3000` for a dev server. Navigate then to `http://localhost:3000/` to see running jquery sample.
